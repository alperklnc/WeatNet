# Koc University COMP 416: Computer Network course project 1
# WeatNet: Development of Weather Reporting Network Application

This project work is about the application layer of the network protocol stack. It involves application layer software development, client/server protocol, application layer protocol principles, socket programming, and multithreading. Through this project, we developed a weather reporting network application (WeatNet) by interacting with the application layer abstract programming interface (API) of OpenWeatherMap (openweathermap.org).

In this project, we developed a weather reporting network application based on the client/server model. WeatNet server provides two types of TCP connections to interact with the clients: One connection for exchanging the protocol commands, and one for data transfers. The WeatNet server also takes the responsibility of interacting with a OpenWeatherNet web server using the OpenWeatherMap API.
